When Christmas morning came he was a new man, 

he had a better plan

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Oh Mr. Scrooge was not the only guy 

who saw the guiding light out of a snowy sky. 

You can feel the magic if you close your eyes

**All: (Singing)**

And let the love pour right in. 

Share the joy 

and the spirit of the season.
