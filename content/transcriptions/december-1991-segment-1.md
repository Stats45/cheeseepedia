**Pasqually:**

Hey!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Come on, everybody!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah, gather round!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

We want you to sing some Christmas songs with us.

**Pasqually:**

Right

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And we’ll start out with something everybody knows

**All: (Singing)**

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh. 

O’er the fields we go laughing all the way

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright. 

What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

**All: (Singing)**

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

**Mr. Munch:**

Boy, do I wish I could be Santa Claus. Course I got the wrong color fur, don’t I?

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Up on the housetop reindeer paws. 

Up jumps good old Santa Claus. 

Down through the chimney with lots of toys. 

All for the little ones, Christmas joys

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Ho, ho, ho

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Who wouldn’t go?

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Ho, ho, ho

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Who wouldn’t go

**All: (Singing)**

Up on the housetop. Click, click, click. 

Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick

**Helen Henny:**

Good little boys and girls can always count on Santa. 

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

First comes the stocking of little Nell, oh dear Santa, fill it well! 

Give her a dolly that laughs and cries, one that will open and shut her eyes

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Ho, ho, ho

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Who wouldn’t go?

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Ho, ho, ho

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Who wouldn’t go

**All: (Singing)**

Up on the housetop. Click, click, click. 

Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick

**Helen Henny:**

Take it, kids!

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Woo, this is fun

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Come on, everybody

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Ho ho ho

**All: (Singing)**

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. 

Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Boy do I love Christmas

**Kids:**:

Yeah

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, what’s everybody been doing this holiday season?

**Pasqually:**

Oh I baked some Christmas cookies with the little sprinkles on top

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Wow

**Helen Henny:**

And I’ve been going shopping

**Mr. Munch:**

And I’ve been building big snowmen

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

And I’ve been decorating with bow wow wows of holly

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

I’m the kind of guy who has lots of friends. 

I’d like to write them all before the season ends. 

Writing these cards is gonna give me a cramp, 

I don’t wanna lick one more stamp

**Mr. Munch: (Singing)**

Give me a break, Chuck E. That’s a breeze, 

I’m the guy wrestlin’ these Christmas trees. 

I love it when the pine scent tingles my nose, 

but ouch when the pine needles prick my toes

**All: (Singing)**

Christmas, Christmas what a job, it’s the busiest time of year. 

I’ve worked this hard all year long to keep that holiday cheer

**Helen Henny: (Singing)**

Went to the mall cause I needed to shop. 

Crowds were so big, I thought I’d drop. 

All the folks were cutting up and having a ball. 

I really had a blast at the shopping mall!

**Pasqually: (Singing)**

Dicing, chopping, blending, and kneading. 

Christmas appetites need lots of feeding. 

Holiday feasts are a chance to show 

special recipes that I happen to know

**All: (Singing)**

Christmas, Christmas what a job, it’s the busiest time of year. 

I’ve worked this hard all year long to keep that holiday cheer

**Helen Henny:**

Jasper, you sure looked handsome the other night

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeah, but learning how to tie that bow tie? 

**Jasper T. Jowls: (Singing)**

Cumberbund, top hat, coat and tie 

are not the clothes I usually buy. 

I wear these clothes for a special reason, 

I wanna look good for the Christmas season

**Kids: (Singing)**:

Playing outside till our cheeks get pink. 

Riding round in circles on the ice skating rink. 

Racing our sleds to the bottom of the hill. 

Singing songs of joy and goodwill

**All: (Singing)**

Christmas, Christmas what a job, it’s the busiest time of year. 

I’ve worked this hard all year round to keep that holiday cheer.

Christmas, Christmas what a job, it’s the busiest time of year. 

I’ve worked this hard all year round to keep that holiday cheer

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

We’ll have some more of your old favorite Christmas tunes and some new ones in a little bit
