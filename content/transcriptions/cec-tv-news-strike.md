**Narrator:**

On the land, in the air, or out at sea, if something is happening somewhere,

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

It’s news to me! Heheheheh.

**Narrator:**

CECTV presents the Chuck E. Cheese news! Featuring news hound Jasper T. Jowls! Plucky reporter Helen Henny! Foreign correspondent Pasqually! 

**Pasqually:**

Eh, Ciao! Hehe. 

**Narrator:**

And Mr. Munch, taking care of the leftovers!

**Mr. Munch:**

Mmm, did I hear somebody say Chow? Haha, mmm. 

**Narrator:** 

Take it away Chuck E! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh sure Larry!

**[Chuck gets handed a paper version of the work “it”]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

There *it* is! And now I’ll take *it* away! Heheheheh. Well folks at the top of our show today is some really earth shaking news! 

**[Chuck E’s room starts to shake]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah! Phew! That really was earth shaking news. But now let’s see what else is shaking. The news division of a major television network ground to a halt today when all of the TV reporters went out on strike. Wow, being on strike means that they’re not working! And here with more about that story is our TV reporter Jasper T. Jowls! 

**[Scene shifts to Jasper holding a sign]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Sorry Chuck E, I can’t tell you about the story because I *am* the story! I’m on strike! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh, hehehehe, well then. Uh- here’s Pasqually with that story!

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually, who is also holding a sign]**

**Pasqually:**

My apologies Chuck E but I’m on strike too! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Pasqually’s on strike too hm? Heheh, uh- Munch? 

**[Scene shifts to Munch also holding a sign]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Sorry old Chuck old pal, if Pasqually’s strike two that makes me strike three, you’re out! Ha ha ha. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Gee. I hope that Helen Henny isn’t a member of the strike. 

**[Scene shifts to Helen standing in front of all the gangs signs]**

**Helen Henny:**

No I’m not a member of the strike, I’m the leader of the strike! And we’re not going back to work for CECTV until our demands have been met! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Right arm!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well what are your demands Jasper? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh! Well uh- for starters, I’m tired of working like a dog! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yeah but you are a dog!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh gee, you got a point there. But I am tired of working for chicken feed!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

That’s not yours Jasper! The chicken feed is for Helen! There must have been some mistake on payday, heh. 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh, uh well here you go Helen! 

**Helen Henny:**

Thank you Jasper! And I guess these must be yours?

**[Helen hands Jasper a large dog bone]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh, well I’ve got what I wanted so I’m not on strike after all! I’ll be right in Chuck E! 

**Helen Henny:**

And I don’t have a bone to pick with you either, sorry about the mix up. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh, that’s ok Helen. Ok that’s two reporters who are coming back to work! Now let’s see what we can do for the others! Are you there Munch? 

**Mr. Munch:**

I sure am but don’t go offering me any bones or chicken feed! I need something else entirely! Haha, cause I’m having trouble just making ends meet haha. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You mean you have trouble paying your bills?

**Mr. Munch:**

No, I have trouble making my ends meet. I can’t touch my toes. My spare tire has a little too much tread on it, haha. But I could go to a real nice exercise club if I just had a bigger salary! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

You don’t need a bigger *salary* Munch, you just need a bigger *celery*! Here, this’ll help you lose a little weight! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Now there’s a celery to be proud of! Looks like my salad days are here! Hahaha! I’ll be right in Chuck E! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Good! We’ve got Jasper, Helen, and Munch back to work! So that just leaves Pasqually! 

**Pasqually:**
Yes. But I’m not ending this strike until I really get what’s coming to me! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

What’s that? 

**Pasqually:**

All day long it’s the same thing, do a news story, then run back into the kitchen to make a pizza, do a story make a pizza, do a story make a pizza, do a story make a pizza!

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

So what do you want?

**Pasqually:**

Hey! If I’m gonna keep working like this, I need a lot more dough! And I want it *right now*! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Ok. 

**[Actual pizza dough drops from the sky onto Pasqually]**

**Pasqually: (Muffled)**

Thank you Chuck E, I uh- I think I’ll uh come in and make some pizzas now hehe. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Terrific! That means all of our CECTV news reporters are back on the job, ready to bring you all the latest news! But speaking of being late, our time is up haha.

**[The word time floats up across the screen]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

See? Told ya time was up. Anyway, thanks for tuning in and remember, if no news is good news, then we’ve got the best news on TV! See ya later!

**[Screen starting shaking again]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Woaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!
