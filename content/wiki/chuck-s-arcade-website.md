## History

Allegedly the site was going to be on chucksarcade.com, which had already been previously owned by Chuck Hess. Chuck stated that he recieved an anonymous offer for $1,000 to buy his url in early/mid 2025, to which he counter offered for $10,000. The broker refused the offer and did not counter-offer. CEC's Chuck's Arcade website would be hosted on chucksarcade.fun shortly after. {{< cite 5 >}}

The earliest Wayback Machine archive of the site dates to June 28th, 2025,{{< cite 1 >}} in advance of CEC officially announcing the chain on June 30th.{{< cite 2 >}} This early version of the site noticeably includes what appears to be a placeholder illustration of an arcade at the top, instead of the actual photographs that would be used later.
On or around July 1st, the site would be updated, adding a list of locations and a promotional video while also replacing the aforementioned placeholder with real location photos.{{< cite 3 >}} By the following day, it would be updated again to list the then-forthcoming Brea, CA location.{{< cite 4 >}}
